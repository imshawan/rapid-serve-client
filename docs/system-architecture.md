# RapidServe - High-Performance Distributed File Storage & Delivery System

## System Architecture
RapidServe is a distributed file storage system designed for efficiency, scalability, and security. It ensures seamless file storage, retrieval, synchronization, and sharing while maintaining fault tolerance and high availability. The system consists of multiple interconnected services to optimize performance and user experience.

## Frontend
The frontend is the primary user interface across web, mobile, and desktop platforms. It interacts with the backend via APIs and provides:
- A seamless user experience with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**.
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- File upload, download, preview, and sharing functionalities.
- Real-time synchronization of file changes.

## Metadata Service
The **Metadata Service** is responsible for tracking file details and ensuring efficient storage management:
- Stores file metadata, including **name, size, version, and permissions**.
- Utilizes **MongoDB** to maintain chunk mappings.
- Supports **deduplication** by checking **SHA-256 hash values** to prevent redundant uploads.
- Generates a **unique File ID** for each uploaded file.

## File Storage Service
The **File Storage Service** handles all file storage and retrieval operations:
- Implements **file chunking**, breaking files into **4MB chunks**.
- Uses **AWS S3** for efficient storage with automatic replication.
- Generates **pre-signed URLs** for direct client uploads.
- Ensures **fault tolerance** by maintaining **redundant copies** of data.

## Security
Security is a core aspect of RapidServe, providing:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage permissions.
- **Tokenized file access** to prevent unauthorized retrieval.
- **End-to-end encryption** for both stored and in-transit data.
- **Data integrity validation** via **SHA-256 checksum verification**.

## Caching System
A multi-layered caching strategy reduces latency and database load:
- **LRU (Least Recently Used) cache** for quick lookups.
- **Distributed Redis caching** to store frequently accessed metadata.
- **Preloaded file previews** to enhance response times for large files.

## File Operations
### File Upload Workflow
1. **Client Uploads a File**
   - Splits file into **4MB chunks**.
   - Computes **SHA-256 hash** for each chunk.
   - Sends **metadata registration request** (`POST /api/upload/chunk/register`).
2. **Metadata Processing**
   - Checks for **existing chunks** to prevent redundant uploads.
   - Stores metadata and generates a **unique File ID**.
3. **Chunk Upload & Storage**
   - Provides **pre-signed URLs** for each chunk.
   - Client uploads directly to **AWS S3**.
4. **Final Acknowledgment**
   - Backend verifies **chunk integrity & file completeness**.
   - Confirms **upload success** with a **200 OK response**.

**Optimizations:**
- **Parallel Uploads** → Upload multiple chunks simultaneously. (upcoming feature)
- **Resumable Uploads** → Retry failed chunks without restarting.
- **Deduplication** → Skip re-uploading existing chunks.

### File Download Workflow
1. **Client Requests a File**
   - Calls `GET /api/download/{{fileId}}`.
2. **Metadata Lookup**
   - Retrieves **chunk mappings & secure tokens**.
3. **Secure Chunk Retrieval**
   - Client downloads each chunk using **tokenized access**.
   - Server validates **tokens before serving data**.
4. **Client Verification & Assembly**
   - Verifies **SHA-256 hash** for each chunk.
   - Merges chunks to reconstruct the file.

**Optimizations:**
- **Parallel Downloads** → Faster retrieval. (upcoming feature)
- **Token Expiry** → Prevents misuse.
- **No Direct Storage Exposure** → Enhances security.

## File Preview System
1. **Client Requests Preview**
   - Calls `GET /api/files/preview/{{fileId}}`.
2. **Metadata Verification**
   - Checks **file type & size**.
3. **Preview Generation**
   - **Files ≤ 5MB** → Serve full file.
   - **Files > 5MB** → Load first few chunks.

**Optimizations:**
- **Efficient Previews** → Fetch only required data.
- **Secure Access** → Prevents unauthorized file exposure.
- **Adaptive Streaming** → Supports progressive loading for large files.

## Future Enhancements
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement real-time alerts and system health tracking.
- **Resumable Downloads:** Enable users to continue downloads after interruptions.
- **Advanced File Sharing:** Support user-defined permissions and expiration policies.
- **Intelligent Load Balancing:** Optimize storage node selection for improved performance.

RapidServe ensures **efficiency, security, and scalability** for all file operations, making it an ideal distributed storage solution.
